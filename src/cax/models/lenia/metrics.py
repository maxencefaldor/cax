"""Metrics function for Lenia.

This file contains an example implementation of a metrics function, `metrics_fn`, specifically
designed for the Lenia model.

The function is responsible for calculating various statistical measures within the Lenia world,
including the mass, center of mass, and other pertinent metrics. These computations are essential
for analyzing the state and dynamics of the Lenia system.
