"""Update modules for Cellular Automata.

This module contains various update mechanisms used in Cellular Automata
implementations. These update modules are responsible for determining the
next state of each cell based on its current state and the information
gathered from its neighborhood.

Available update modules may include:
- Rule-based updates
- Neural network-based updates
- Custom update mechanisms

These modules are designed to work with the CAX library, providing flexible
and efficient update options for different types of cellular automata
models.
